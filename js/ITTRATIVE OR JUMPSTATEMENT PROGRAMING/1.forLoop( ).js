/*The For Loop==>
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
    for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
      // code block to be executed
    }
Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. 
Example    */

for(let i = 1; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i + " manish mehta ");
}

/*From the example above, you can read:
Expression 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 1).
Expression 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 10).
Expression 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
